# Chess_AI
This project aims at automatic Chess AI.

We implemented two versions of AI:

 - `Cut`, which can be launched by `python3 chess_Auto.py`.
 - `Socrates`, a little bit stronger AI, which can be launched by `python2 socrates.py`.
 - `Socrates Ancient`, a faster but much more stupid AI, which can be launched by `python2 socretes_ancient.py`.

# Requirement
1. Python 2
2. Python 3.5+
3. Pypy 2
4. Python Library -- `python-chess`
5. [TheChessBoard] -- The platform of this AI competition. [TheChessBoard Release]

>~~(suggested pip command for Chinese users:</br>~~
>~~pip --default-timeout=6000 install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple --upgrade python-chess(or pygame) )~~

If you can get across the Great Firewall, nothing could be your problem.

# Declaration
This repository is only for our project involved in a competition in AI course.

Because of we are all newbies in chess artificial intelligence, these AIs are far less developed and far less clever.
